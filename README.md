# YouTube Data Harvesting and Warehousing using SQL and Streamlit

# Project Description
# This project involves building an interactive web application using Streamlit that allows users to retrieve and analyze YouTube channel data. 
# By integrating with the Google YouTube API, the application collects various data points from multiple YouTube channels, such as channel details, video statistics, and comments. 
# This data is then stored in a SQL database (MySQL or PostgreSQL) to enable advanced search and analytics features.

# Key Features:
# Retrieve YouTube Channel Data: Users can input a YouTube channel ID and retrieve information like channel name, subscriber count, total videos, playlist ID, etc.
# Multi-Channel Data Collection: Allows data collection for up to 10 different YouTube channels at once.
# Store in SQL Database: Data is stored in MySQL or PostgreSQL, making it easy to scale and query.
# Data Analysis: Perform queries to find top-performing videos, analyze comment counts, view counts, likes/dislikes, and more.
# Interactive Visualization: Use Streamlit to display data interactively, with search and filtering options.

# Tech Stack:
# Python: For scripting and data handling.
# Streamlit: To create an interactive UI for data analysis.
# Google YouTube API: For retrieving YouTube data.
# SQL (MySQL/PostgreSQL): To store and query the data.
